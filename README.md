# CSC8508

## Description

This program was written for a university course module: CSC8508 "Engineering Gaming Solutions within a Team".\
\
The concept of this project was to demonstrate our ability to work as part of a larger team to create a functional video game with the focus being primarily on software engineering over design.\
\
Our final project titled "Slippy Sam" is focussed around the player character, a prison inmate, attempting to escape. To do this he must navigate a maze-like prison complex, avoiding patrolling guards, pursuing dogs (goats) and vigilant cameras to reach the exit while collecting as many coins as he can. 

## Personal Contribution

I was Lead AI Developer, responsible for designing and implementing AI solutions for non-playable entities within the game including the guards, dogs and cameras. I implemented the "lives" and "respawn" mechanics for the player as well as the base code for the coin collectables.
